Our community enables [UEFI] firmware and tools through various open
source projects.

Most of our efforts are currently related to the [EDK II] project, so
if you are developer, then this is a good place to start contributing
to our community.

UEFI developers are the primary focus of our community, but if you are
interested in trying to use UEFI, then we have a page on how to [Start
using UEFI]({{wiki}}/start-using-UEFI).

There are several ways to participate in our community. Anyone can
join our [Mailing Lists]({{wiki}}/Mailing%20Lists) to discuss UEFI
related topics.
